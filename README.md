#Making Changes to the DynamoDB Table and Verifying the Trigger.
We will add new (additional) item to the table but we can also make some changes in the DynamoDB table item that we've created, which will kick off the lambda to deliver a database snapshot to S3. 

But i will create an additional item for this example.

Note: This resource must be deployed as a test for dynamodb trigger => to trigger lambda 
resource "aws_dynamodb_table_item" "item4" 
You can find this info in dynamodb.tf file last block, for this article i will hide it from terraform with hashtag but once you clone this repo, leave as it is with hastag but after deploying the entire infra in first deployment (first apply) if it's successful then come to this additional(item4) to get ride of hashtag but on this iteam and run again terraform apply -auto-apply (as a second deployment)


To verify that, navigate to the S3 and click on the bucket then Select data.txt file and click on Download.

Wait for some time and refresh the page, if you do not see the data.txt file inside the S3 bucket.

Open the data.txt file and verify that the contents of the text file are in the JSON format.

Updated content will be available in the data.txt.

Repeat the procedure of updating and adding new items to the table to see the change reports in S3.
